Data Exploration with Pandas by Analysing the Post-University Salaries of Graduates by Major
 
PayScale Inc. did a year-long survey of 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor's degree. I'll analyze this data and use Pandas to answer these questions:

   1.Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 
   2. Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?
   3. Which degrees have the highest earning potential?
   4. What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?
   5. Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?


What I can do:

   1. How to explore a Pandas DataFrame
   2. How to detect NaN (not a number) values and clean data
   3. How to select particular columns, rows, and individual cells
   4. How to sort data
   5. How to group data by category
